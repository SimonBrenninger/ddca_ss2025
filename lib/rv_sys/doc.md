# RISC-V System Package
The purpose of the RISC-V System Package (`rv_sys_pkg`) and the related Software Development Kit (SDK) is to provide a framework that allows you to compile software for, simulate and synthesize the various RISC-V processor cores you will implement in this lecture.
To that end the package provides two modules named `rv_sys` and `memu`.

## Overview

While the [RISC-V ISA](../rv_core/doc.md) specifies the instruction of a processor and thus what operations it can perform, it does not really define the processor's surroundings except for the fact that 32-bit instruction- and data words are used.
Where these data words come from and what the respective interface looks like is left to the implementation.
Such details are part of what is referred to as the microarchitecture.
The purpose of this package is to specify and provide the memory subsystem of the DDCA RISC-V processing systems.



## Components

### `rv_sys`
The `rv_sys` module implements the memory subsytem of a RISC-V processing system.
It contains the data and instruction memories, as well as some memory mapped I/O devices.
These devices include a timer, a UART controller and some general purpose inputs and outputs (GPIOs).
The program and instruction memories can be programmed via a JTAG interface from the host PC (details in the SDK section).
For simulation purposes it is also possible to load data and instruction memory contents from files.


```vhdl
component rv_sys is
	generic (
		BAUD_RATE         : natural := 115200;
		CLK_FREQ          : natural := 75000000;
		SIMULATE_ELF_FILE : string  := "OFF";
		GPIO_ADDR_WIDTH   : natural := 8;
		DMEM_DELAY        : natural := 0;
		IMEM_DELAY        : natural := 0
	);
	port (
		clk   : in std_ulogic;
		res_n : in std_ulogic;

		cpu_reset_n : out std_ulogic;

		-- instruction memory interface
		imem_out : in  mem_out_t;
		imem_in  : out mem_in_t;

		-- data memory interface
		dmem_out : in  mem_out_t;
		dmem_in  : out mem_in_t;

		-- UART port
		rx : in  std_ulogic;
		tx : out std_ulogic;

		-- GPIO
		gp_out : out mem_data_array_t(2**GPIO_ADDR_WIDTH-1 downto 0);
		gp_in  : in  mem_data_array_t(2**GPIO_ADDR_WIDTH-1 downto 0)
	);
end component;
```


#### Interface

The `clk` signal is the clock input, `res_n` is an asynchronous active-low, reset.
The `CLK_FREQ` generic must be set to match the frequency of `clk` (in Hz).

The `cpu_reset_n` signal is an active-low reset that resets the RISC-V core connected to `rv_sys`.
Details on its behavior can be found in the Implementation section below.

The `rv_sys` module provides interfaces to two memories: an instruction memory (`imem_*` signals) and a data memory (`dmem_*` signals).
Note that these signals are named from the processor's point of view (i.e., the processor's instruction memory *output* interface is called *imem_out* in the `rv_sys` interface).
Both memories hold 32-bit wide data words, are **word-addressed**, and use a **big-endian** byte ordering (i.e., the most significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address).

To enable the attached RISC-V processor to conveniently communicate with a host PC, the `rv_sys` module integrates a UART controller, which produces the `tx` signal and reads the `rx` signal.
The baud rate of this interface can be set using the `BAUD_RATE` generic (the baud rate is given in symbols per second).

Finally, the core also features `2**GPIO_ADDR_WIDTH` software read- / write-able 32-bit general purpose inputs (`gp_in`) and outputs (`gp_out`), which can be used to connect other devices, like the FPGA board's I/O.

The generic `SIMULATE_ELF_FILE` is used to initialize the data and instruction memory during simulation.
For synthesis its value must be set to "OFF".




#### Implementation

The `cpu_reset_n` reset signal is connected to `res_n` in simulations. enabling you to simply use a single global reset for the overall system.
On the actual hardware, this signal is controlled via JTAG, allowing your CPU to be reset automatically (e.g., after downloading a new program).


The signals of `mem_out_t` (provided by the processor) have the following semantics.
The `rd` and `wr` signals are active-high and must be set for a read / write operation to the respective memory.
The address associated with this operation is `address`.
In case of a write operation the data to be written must obviously also be provided.
This is done via the `wrdata` field of the `mem_out_t` record.
Furthermore, there is also a byte-enable (`byteena`) signal for facilitating sub-word (write) access to the respective memory.
If bit $b_i$â€‹ of the `byteena` signal is asserted the corresponding byte $i$ of the addressed word will be written (interpreted from the **memory's point of view**).


The signals of `mem_in_t` (provided by the memories to the processor) have the following semantics.
`busy` is asserted during an on-going memory operation.
While this signal is asserted no new memory operation (neither read nor write) must be issued.
`rd_data` provides the result of a read operation. This value is only valid when `busy` is low.



### `memu`
The Memory Unit (`memu`) is a simple combinational module that converts byte-addressed memory operations (generated by a processor) to the word-addressing big-endian format required to operate the `{i,d}mem_{in,out}` signal of the `rv_sys` core.

```vhdl
component memu is
	port (
		op     : in  memu_op_t;
		addr   : in  mem_data_t;
		wrdata : in  mem_data_t;
		rddata : out mem_data_t := (others => '0');
		busy   : out std_ulogic := '0';

		xl : out std_ulogic := '0';
		xs : out std_ulogic := '0';

		-- to rv_sys
		mem_in  : in  mem_in_t;
		mem_out : out mem_out_t
	);
end component;
```


#### Interface

The `op` input of type `memu_op_t` is used to issue memory operations to the `memu`.
Whereas the `op` input provides the control data for a operation, the respective memory address (byte address!) and write data (in **little-endian** byte order) are provided at `addr` and `wrdata`, respectively.
The result of a read operation is provided at `rddata` in **little-endian** byte ordering (as expected by the processor).


`busy` is asserted during an on-going memory operation.
While this signal is asserted no new memory operation (neither read nor write) must be issued.
Note that the value of `rddata` is only guaranteed to be valid when `busy` is low.


The output `xl` and `xs` indicate load and store exceptions caused by [unaligned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error#Unaligned_access) memory accesses.
These signals can be used by a processor to jump to an exception handler.


The `mem_in` and `mem_out` act as counterparts for the `[d,i]mem_[out,in]` signals of `rv_sys`, thus allowing the `memu` to be directly connected to an `rv_sys` memory interface.




#### Implementation

The following table shows how the `mem_out.byteena` and `mem_out.wrdata` signals are set for memory write operations (i.e., `op.wr`=1).
It is assumed that the data word to be written (i.e., `wrdata`) has the format $b_3b_2b_1b_0$ with $b_3$ being the most significant byte.
A value $b_0XXX$ in the last column states that the most significant byte of `mem_out.wrdata` is the least significant byte of $wrdata$ and that the other bytes are irrelevant and may contain arbitrary values

The input `addr` denotes the byte address as provided by the processor.
The address output `mem_out.address` is generated by right-shifting `addr` by two positions.

| `op.access_type` | `addr(1 downto 0)` | `mem_out.byteena` | `mem_out.wrdata` |
| --------- | ------------ | ------- | ------ |
| `MEM_B` (store byte) | 00 | 1000 | $b_0XXX$ |
| `MEM_B` (store byte) | 01 | 0100 | $Xb_0XX$ |
| `MEM_B` (store byte) | 10 | 0010 | $XXb_0X$ |
| `MEM_B` (store byte) | 11 | 0001 | $XXXb_0$ |
| | | | |
| `MEM_H` (store halfword) | 00, 01 | 1100 | $b_0b_1XX$ |
| `MEM_H` (store halfword) | 10, 11 | 0011 | $XXb_0b_1$ |
| | | | |
| `MEM_W` (store word)| XX | 1111 | $b_0b_1b_2b_3$ |


For read operations (i.e., `op.rd`=1), the memory returns the data (`mem_in.rddata`) with the format $=b_3b_2b_1b_0$ (with $b_3$ being the MSB).
The table below shows how the `memu` generates the `rddata` output.
$S$ denotes a sign-extended and $0$ a zero-filled byte.
For example, $SSSb_3$ means that the result of the read operation is the sign-extended most significant byte of the memory interface's `rddata` signal.

| `op.access_type` | `addr(1 downto 0)` | `rddata` |
| --------- | ------------ | ------ |
| `MEM_B` (load byte) | 00 | $SSSb_3$ |
| `MEM_B` (load byte) | 01 | $SSSb_2$ |
| `MEM_B` (load byte) | 10 | $SSSb_1$ |
| `MEM_B` (load byte) | 11 | $SSSb_0$ |
| | | |
| `MEM_BU` (load byte unsigned) | 00 | $000b_3$ |
| `MEM_BU` (load byte unsigned) | 01 | $000b_2$ |
| `MEM_BU` (load byte unsigned) | 10 | $000b_1$ |
| `MEM_BU` (load byte unsigned) | 11 | $000b_0$ |
| | | |
| `MEM_H` (load halfword) | 00, 01 | $SSb_2b_3$ |
| `MEM_H` (load halfword) | 10, 11 | $SSb_0b_1$ |
| | | |
| `MEM_HU` (load halfword unsigned) | 00, 01 | $00b_2b_3$ |
| `MEM_HU` (load halfword unsigned) | 10, 11 | $00b_0b_1$ |
| | | |
| `MEM_W` (load word) | XX | $b_0b_1b_2b_3$ |

    constant RV_SYS_ADDR_WIDTH : positive := 14;
    constant RV_SYS_DATA_WIDTH : positive := 32;
    ```
    
    Address and data widths of the instruction and data memories provided by `rv_sys` (in bits).
    Note that the address width refers to the addressable **words** rather than bytes!
    
    
---


-   ```vhdl
    subtype mem_address_t    is std_ulogic_vector(RV_SYS_ADDR_WIDTH-1 downto 0);
    subtype mem_data_t       is std_ulogic_vector(RV_SYS_DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0);
    subtype mem_byteena_t    is std_ulogic_vector(RV_SYS_DATA_WIDTH/8-1 downto 0);
    ```
    
    Utility subtypes for interfacing with the instruction and data memories.
    Note that `mem_address_t` holds **word** addresses.
    
    
---


-   ```vhdl
    type mem_out_t is record
    	address  : mem_address_t;
    	rd       : std_ulogic;
    	wr       : std_ulogic;
    	byteena  : mem_byteena_t;
    	wrdata   : mem_data_t;
    end record;
    ```
    
    The `mem_out_t` record type combines all processor outputs going to a connected memory.
    It contains elements for the word-address (`address`), for read / write (`rd` / `wr`) operations and for the write data (`wrdata`).
    
    
---


-   ```vhdl
    constant MEM_OUT_NOP : mem_out_t := (
    	address => (others => '0'),
    	rd      => '0',
    	wr      => '0',
    	byteena => (others => '1'),
    	wrdata  => (others => '0')
    );
    ```
    
    Default value for `mem_out_t` that corresponds to doing no operation (*nop*) at a respective interface to a memory.
    
---


-   ```vhdl
    type mem_in_t is record
    	busy   : std_ulogic;
    	rddata : mem_data_t;
    end record;
    ```
    
    The `mem_in_t` record type combines all memory outputs connected to processor inputs.
    The `rddata` signal contains the read data, while the `busy` signal is asserted during an ongoing memory operation.
    
    While busy is asserted no new memory operation (read or write) may be issued.
    The rddata signal is only valid when busy is low.
    
    
---


-   ```vhdl
    constant MEM_IN_NOP : mem_in_t := (
    	busy   => '0',
    	rddata => (others => '0')
    );
    ```
    
    Default value for `mem_in_t` that corresponds to doing no operation (*nop*) at the respective connected interface to a memory.
    
---


-   ```vhdl
    type mem_data_array_t is array(natural range<>) of mem_data_t;
    ```
    
    The `mem_data_t` array type can be used to refer to regions / section of `rv_sys` arrays (e.g., for special memory regions like the addressable GPIO).
    
---


-   ```vhdl
    type memu_op_t is record
    	rd          : std_ulogic;
    	wr          : std_ulogic;
    	access_type : memu_access_type_t;
    end record;
    ```
    
    Contains the control information required for a single operation of the `memu`.
    For read / write operations `rd` / `wr` must be asserted, `access_type` is the respective access type (see below).
    
    
---


-   ```vhdl
    type memu_access_type_t is (
    	MEM_B,
    	MEM_BU,
    	MEM_H,
    	MEM_HU,
    	MEM_W
    );
    ```
    
    This enum type defines the various access modes for memory operations performed by / at the `memu`.
    It supports (unsigned) byte accesses (`MEM_B[U]`), (unsigned) halfword (i.e., 16 bit) accesses (`MEM_H[U]`) and word accesses (`MEM_W`).
    
    
---


-   ```vhdl
    constant MEMU_NOP : memu_op_t := (
    	rd          => '0',
    	wr          => '0',
    	access_type => MEM_W
    );
    ```
    
    Default value for `memu_op_t` that corresponds to no operation (*nop*) at the respective memu interface.
    
    




## Subprograms
```vhdl
function swap_endianness(i : mem_data_t) return mem_data_t;
```

The `swap_endianness` function returns the value passed via its paramete r `i` in reversed byte order.
I.e., it can be used to convert between little endian and big endian byte ordering.






## Software Development Kit (SDK)

In order to compile any software in the VM, you first have to copy the appropriate RISC-V compiler from the lab.
Execute the following commands inside the VM:

```bash
scp USERNAME@ssh.tilab.tuwien.ac.at:/opt/ddca/riscv.tar.gz .
sudo mkdir -p /opt/ddca
sudo tar -xvf riscv.tar.gz -C /opt/ddca/
```

Don't change any of the paths and place the compiler exactly in this directory, otherwise it will not work.


The [`sdk`](sdk) directory contains [`Makefile`](Makefile)s that implement all the required steps to compile C or assembly programs and to download the generated binaries to the data and instruction memories of an `rv_sys` instance.
In order to use them, you have to create a [`Makefile`](Makefile) and include either [rv_asm.mk](./sdk/rv_asm.mk) or for assembly programs or [rv_c.mk](./sdk/rv_c.mk) for C-programs.
You will find more details about what to include and to configure for creating your own testcases further below in the *Testcases* section of this documentation.
However, including the respective [`Makefile`](Makefile) allows compiling testcases inside their respective directory (e.g., calling `make` in `testcases/asm/send_uart`).

Successful compilation of a testcase (no matter if C or assembly) generates a `.elf` executable file, as well as the files `.imem.mif` and `.dmem.mif`, which contain the contents of the instruction and data memories, respectively.
E.g., for the `send_uart` test case the files `[`send_uart.elf`](testcases/asm/send_uart/send_uart.elf)`, `[`send_uart.imem.mif`](testcases/asm/send_uart/send_uart.imem.mif)` and `[`send_uart.dmem.mif`](testcases/asm/send_uart/send_uart.dmem.mif)` files will be created.
The `.mif` files are **human-readable** and can be quite useful for debugging processors.
In particular, each row of the file contains a single instruction / data word where the row number is the word address (starting at 0).

The `clean` target can then be used to delete all files created during compilation.


After a program has been compiled successfully, it can be downloaded to the actual processing system running on the FPGA (i.e., the data and instruction memories in the `rv_sys` module).
To do so, first program the FPGA with the desired bitstream (SOF file) and then execute the `run` [`Makefile`](Makefile) target in the respective testcase directory.

You can also use the `remote_run` target to download your program to a board in the Remote Lab.
To use this target you must already have an active connection to the Remote Lab, i.e., either via `rpa_shell.py` or `rpa_gui.py`.




## Testcases

We already provide you with some demo programs, which can be used to test RISC-V processors attached to the `rv_sys` core in the [testcases](./testcases) directory.
The provided testcases can be categorized into those that are directly written in our ISA's assembly language, and those that are written in C.

While C allows you to write complex programs a lot more efficiently and less error-prone than in assembly, for debugging a processor, writing and running assembly code is strongly recommended, as this gives you (almost) full control of what is actually executed.
Later in the development you can switch to C to try more elaborate programs.


For C-programs we provide you with some library functions in [util.h](sdk/util.h).
Use these functions to write to (and potentially read from) the UART interface and to read and write the GPIOs.
Please note that the program is not linked against a full-featured *libc*.
Therefore, not all standard functions are working.


While the testcases we provide you with are a first starting point, they are insufficient for debugging your processor.
You will therefore have to create your own testcases.
In the following we'll explain how this can be done.

First, we recommend you to create your testcases in a distinct directory in [testcases](testcases/) (e.g., `testcases/user`),
where each testcase resides in a respective subdirectory.
Each testcase consists of the following files (where TESTCASE is the name of the particular testcase):

- `[`Makefile`](Makefile)`: For assembly language testcases this file only needs to include the [`rv_asm.mk`](sdk/rv_asm.mk) file.
  For C-programs the [`rv_c.mk`](sdk/rv_c.mk) file must be included and additionally, the source files and the target file name must be specified using the `SRC_FILES` and `ELF_NAME` Make variables.
  You can find an example in, e.g., [`uart_loopback`](testcases/c/uart_loopback/Makefile).

- `TESTCASE.rvtc.mk`: This is the *RISC-V Testcase* (rvtc) [`Makefile`](Makefile) of the respective testcase.
  It basically consists of a bunch of Make variables it sets / appends that provide information for the actual simulation.
  This files first needs to append TESTCASE to the `RV_TESTCASES` Make variable (use the `+=` operator) in order to make it "globally" visible for your RISC-V simulations.
  Next, it must provide a name for the testcase (`TESTCASE_NAME`).
  This can, but is not required to, be TESTCASE.
  This name will influence the names of all Make targets created for this particular testcase.
  Next, specify the **entity name** of the respective testbench as `TESTCASE_TB` and the target ELF file as `TESTCASE_ELF` (the whole path, not just the name!).
  You can then, optionally, define further VHDL files that are required for this particular testcase (`TESTCASE_VHDL_FILES`) and a wave file ('TESTCASE_[GTKW_]WAVE_FILE') that overrides one of the task's [`Makefile`](Makefile).
  Finally, arguments can be passed to the simulator (Questasim / GHDL) by setting the `TESTCASE_[GHDL|VSIM]_USER_ARGS`.
  This is paricularly useful for setting generics of the testbench entity.
  More details can be found further below.

- Actual source files. For the assembly test cases this is usually a single file `TESTCASE.S`, for C it might be multiple C files.

- Optional: A VHDL file containing a particular testbench for this testcase (e.g., `TESTCASE_tb.vhd`).
  More details on such testbenches can be found below.


Examples on which you can base your testcases can be found in [send_uart](testcases/asm/send_uart) and [uart_loopback](testcases/c/uart_loopback).

Each testcase adhering to the above structure results in the creation of respective Make targets that can then be used to test your various RV implementations.
In particular, the following targets will be created:

- `TESTCASE_NAME_info`: Dumps information about the testcase like its name, the target elf, used testbench etc.
- `TESTCASE_NAME_[g]sim`: Runs a simulation using GHDL / QuestaSim for the respective testcase in headless mode.
- `TESTCASE_NAME_[g]sim_gui`: Runs a simulation using GHDL / QuestaSim for the respective testcase and opens the waveform viewer.

Furthermore, the [`Makefile`](Makefile) targets `rvall_[g]sim` are provided that run **all** testcases and grep for reports of "PASSED" / "FAILED".
You can use this for simple regression testing.


As mentioned above, each testcase can have a dedicated testbench.
However, such testbenches cannot be arbitrary but must provide at least two generics:

- `TESTCASE_NAME` of type string
- `ELF_FILE` of type string

These generics are then later set to the values of particular testcases by the framework.
Hence, you do not need to provide (default) values for them.
However, you can add aribtrary further generics which are set during simulation by the framework.
An example, is the provided [`rv_uart_io_tb`](tb/rv_uart_io_tb.vhd) testbench that declares a `UART_RX` and `UART_TX` generic and uses them to check recived UART data, and to transmit data via UART by itself.
Such generics can then easily be set in the `TESTCASE.rvtc.mk` file via the `TESTCASE_[GHDL|VSIM]_USER_ARGS` by setting them to particular values using the `-gGENERIC='VALUE'` switch.
You can find an example in [`uart_loopback.rvtc.mk`](testcases/c/uart_loopback/uart_loopback.rvtc.mk).


To assist you in your debugging efforts, `rv_sys` reports certain events for which you can grep in the simulator output.
That way you can easily get "traces" / event sequences for your testcases and thus pinpoint misbehavior of your processor(s).
The following is reported using the listed prefixes for which you can grep:

- Uart transmission: `UART TX`
- Uart reception: `UART RX`
- Write to / read from data memory: `DMEM write` / `DMEM read`
- Read from instruction memory: `IMEM read`
- GPIO access: `GPIO`

For example, to get all UART events (transmission and reception), you could simply run
```bash
make send_uart_gsim | grep UART
```


While all of the above might seem daunting, much of it is optional, allowing you to tailor your testcases and to make them more powerful.
To get you started you can refer to the `startup` assembly testcase which simply checks if a sequence of writes to the data memory is performed correctly.
Later, when you are certain your processor works for such simple cases you can look at the provided UART testcases and create similar ones where UART is used to convey whether a testcase passed or failed.
